## Intro

A project for deerhack 2025 

Author: @chr1sren @dipalh @Dream-ABC

The inspiration for StarLink came from our fascination with the night sky and the desire to make astronomy more accessible to everyone. We wanted to create an interactive tool that allows users to explore and learn about the stars and constellations in a fun and engaging way.

## How to start

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

run `main.py` for basic feature

run `main_with_hand_trace.py` if you want to try hand trace to control the star map

Have fun! :)
